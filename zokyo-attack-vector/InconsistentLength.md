## Inconsistent Block lengths across chains

- `block.number` - refers to the current number of blocks mined since the creation of the blockchain, essentially marking the block's sequental position .It provides a measure of the network progression by counting how many block have been added since genesis block

- `block.timestamp` - Unix timestamp that indicates when a specific block was mined. It gives real-world time, in seconds at which the block was created 

### Incorrect Assumption about Block Nuber in Multi-chain Deployments

In Protocol deployed across multiple chains , assuming a fixd block time of 12 seconds - based on Etherum typical block time - is a critical mistake

This is because not all EVM compatible blockchain operate with the same block times, other chains can be fast or slower block generation

Consequences of Hardcoding Block Number-Based Timing
- Degraded Functionality(locking and unlocking of funds too early or too late)
- Financial Loss
- Protocol Failure(auction Protocol fails)


Ethereum Block Time Can Change
- Network Congestion
- Protocol Upgrades

Best Practices for Mitigating These Vulnerabilities
1. Avoiding Hardcoding Block Time Assumptions(instead of using 12 seconds use the dynamic calculations using `block.timestamp` or specific APIs to account for actual time elapsed)
2. Chain-Agnostic Design(Multiple EVM compatible chains)
3. Handle Block Time Variation(Use `block.timestamp` instead of `block.number`)
4. FallBack Mechanism(: Incorporate fallback mechanisms that can handle delays or faster-than-expected block production, ensuring that critical functionalities like fund management or rewards distribution continue to operate smoothly)
